PLANS FOR DEVELOPMENT!

-Improve stat calculations to be similar to DND 5e (LOL NO)

-Add magical abilities (NOT YET)

v0.3

-Gonna add contents (item objects) to rooms DONE

v0.3.5
-I rly gotta take a shit, leaving this in a (potentially, unlikely) unstable state. Need to do things to make item objects be inherited for making custom items or smthn like that. SO THAT THE CODER CAN CREATE REALLY ADAPTABLE ITEMS! YAY
